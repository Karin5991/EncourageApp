        <h1>Confidence</h1> 
        <p>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. Philippians 1:6</p> 
        <p>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.1 Corinthians 15:58</p> 
        <p>Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10  </p> 
        <p>For not in my bow do I trust, nor can my sword save me. Psalms 44:6  </p> 
        <p>For the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. Proverbs 3:26  </p> 
        <p>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4:16  </p> 
        <p>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 1  John 5:14 </p> 
        <p>A scoffer seeks wisdom in vain, but knowledge is easy for a man of understanding. Proverbs 14:6  </p> 
        <p>I have confidence in the Lord that you will  take no other view, and  the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. Galatians 5:10  </p> 
        <p>For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh. Philippians 3:3 </p> 
        <p>I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13</p> 
        <p>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Hebrews 4:16 </p> 
        <p>So we can confidently say,  â€œThe Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me? Hebrews 13:6 
        <p>And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.1  John 5:14 </p>
