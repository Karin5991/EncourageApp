        <p>I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13</p>
        <p>But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” Mark 5:36</p> 
        <p>Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who wait for the Lord! Psalm 31:24</p>

        <p>Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you.” Deuteronomy 31:6</p> 
        <p>For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. 2 Timothy 1:7</p> 
        <p>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 1 Corinthians 16:13</p> 
        <p>The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion. Proverbs 28:1</p> 
        <p>Wait for the Lord; be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the Lord! Psalm 27:14</p> 
        <p>Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. Proverbs 3:5-6</p> 
        <p>I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world. John 16:33 </p> 
        <p>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD. Psalm 31:24 </p> 
        <p>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 1 Corinthians 16:13 </p> 
        <p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Ephesians 6:10</p> 
        <p>The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Psalm 27:1</p> 
        <p>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 2 Timothy 1:7</p>
