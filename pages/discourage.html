        <h1>Discourage</h1> 
        <p>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 1 Peter 5:7 </p>
        <p>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. Proverbs 3:5-6 </p>
        <p>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God [is] with thee whithersoever thou goest. Joshua 1:9 </p>
        vNow the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. Romans 15:13 </p>
        <p>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. Galatians 6:9 </p>
        <p>And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:19 </p>
        <p>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD. Psalms 31:24 </p>
        <p>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  1 Corinthians 15:58 </p>
        <p>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory;  2 Corinthians 4:17-18 </p>
        <p>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?  Isaiah 53:1-12 </p>
        <p>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28 </p>
        <p>For we walk by faith, not by sight. 2 Corinthians 5:7 </p>
        <p>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Jeremiah 29:11 </p>
        <p>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? Romans 8:31</p>
        <p>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 2 Corinthians 12:9</p>
