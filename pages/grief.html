        <h1>Grief</h1> 
        <p>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matthew 11:28-30</p>

        <p>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. 1 Thessalonians 4:13 </p>

        <p>You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you. Isaiah 26:3</p> 
        <p>A little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me. John 16:16</p> 
        <p>Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. John 14:1 </p> 
        <p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16</p> 
        <p>I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world. John 16:33</p> 
        <p>The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. John 16:33</p> 
        <p>Casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. 1 Peter 5:7 </p> 
        <p>But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. 1 Thessalonians 4:13</p> 
        <p>I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13 </p>
