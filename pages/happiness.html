        <p>Delight yourself also in the LORD: and he shall give you the desires of your heart. Psalms 37:4 </p> 
        <p>Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. Proverbs 14:13 </p> 
        <p>He that handles a matter wisely shall find good: and whoever trusts in the LORD, happy is he. Proverbs 16:20 </p> 
        <p>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life. Ecclesiastes 3:12</p> 
        <p>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of God. Ecclesiastes 3:13</p> 
        <p>Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. Isaiah 12:2 </p> 
        <p>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. Matthew 5:8</p>

        <p>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Romans 5:2 </p> 
        <p>Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice. Philippians 4:4</p> 
        <p>And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:7</p> 
        <p>Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you 1 Peter 4:12 </p>
