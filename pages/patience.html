        <p>Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Ephesians 4:2</p> 
        <p>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. Philippians 4:6</p> 
        <p>Whoever is patient has great understanding, but one who is quick-tempered displays folly. Proverbs 14:29</p> 
        <p>Better a patient person than a warrior, one with self-control than one who takes a city. Proverbs 16:32</p> 
        <p>For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11</p> 
        <p>Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Romans 12:12 </p> 
        <p>Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Galatians 6:9</p> 
        <p>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant. 1 Corinthians 13:4 </p> 
        <p>Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when people succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. Psalm 37:7  </p> 
        <p>Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, for anger lodges in the bosom of fools. Ecclesiastes 7:9 </p> 
        <p>With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, Ephesians 4:2</p> 
        <p>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Romans 12:12 </p> 
        <p>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. Romans 8:25</p> 
        <p>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. Galatians 6:9 </p>
