        <h1>Peace</h1>
        <p>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:7</p>
        <p>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Philemon 1:3 </p>
        <p>See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. 1 Thessalonians 5:15 </p>
        <p>Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. Psalm 34:14 </p>
        <p>And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever. Isaiah 32:17 </p>
        <p>My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. Psalm 73:26 </p>
        <p>Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind. Ecclesiastes 4:6 </p>
        <p>And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. James 3:18 </p>
        <p>May the God of peace be with you all. Amen. Romans 15:33 </p>
        <p>If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. Proverbs 3:24 </p>
        <p>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. James 3:17 </p>
        <p>Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10 </p>
        <p>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. 1 Peter 3:9 </p>
        <p>Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 5:1 </p>
        <p>Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. Psalm 37:4 </p>
        <p>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. Romans 12:17 </p>
        <p>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Thessalonians 5:23</p>
