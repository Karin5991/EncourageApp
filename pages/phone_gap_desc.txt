PLUGINSImagePicker This plugin allows selection of multiple images from the camera roll/gallery in a phonegap app.  With this plugin I could use it on the encourage page. This is the page where a person would first pick an image for the background for their in encourage page. Once they click on a topic, another image or the same one would be at its low opacity, so they could read the encouragement text. I think people will enjoy and I hope bring them more encouragement by having one of thier favorite image displayed.Usage Instructions<gap:plugin name="com.synconset.imagepicker" version="1.0.4" />Example - Get Full Size Images (all default options):window.imagePicker.getPictures(    function(results) {        for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {            console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);        }    }, function (error) {        console.log('Error: ' + error);    });Example - Get at most 10 images scaled to width of 800:window.imagePicker.getPictures(    function(results) {        for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {            console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);        }    }, function (error) {        console.log('Error: ' + error);    }, {        maximumImagesCount: 10,        width: 800    });SocialSharingThis plugin allows you to share text, images (and other files), or a link via the native sharing widget of your device. Android is fully supported, as well as iOS 6 and up. WP8 has somewhat limited support.I would like this plugin to be used on the community page. I think this plug-in will help convey the message "that you are not alone". When you share your plead for help social media will come to the recuse. What encourage you might encourage someone else.Manually1.
