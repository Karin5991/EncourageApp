        <h1>Strength</h1> 
        <p>The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? Psalm 27:1  </p> 
        <p>A joyful heart is good medicine, But a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Proverbs 17:22 </p> 
        <p>Seek the LORD and his strength;  seek his presence continually! 1 Chronicles 16:11 </p> 
        <p>But the salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; He is their strength in time of trouble. Psalm 37:39 </p> 
        <p>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. 1 Thessalonians 5:14  </p> 
        <p>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Romans 12:12 </p> 
        <p>In the day when I cried out, You answered me, and made me bold with strength in my soul. Psalm 138:3</p> 
        <p>I can do all things through him who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13 </p> 
        <p>For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11 </p> 
        <p>But Jesus looked at them and said to them, â€˜With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. Matthew 19:26 </p> 
        <p>For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. 2 Timothy 1:7 </p> 
        <p>For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. Romans 8:6 </p> 
        <p>Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 2 Corinthians 4:16</p> 
        <p>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. Galatians 6:9</p> 
        <p>As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. 2 Thessalonians 3:13</p>
