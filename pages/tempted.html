        <h1>Tempted</h1> 
        <p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Matthew 6:13 </p> 
        <p>But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 1 Timothy 6:9 </p> 
        <p>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Matthew 26:41</p> 
        <p>And when he came to the place, he said to them, â€œPray that you may not enter into temptation. Luke 22:40 </p> 
        <p>No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. 1 Corinthians 10:13 </p> 
        <p>And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time. Luke 4:13 </p> 
        <p>But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 1 Corinthians 7:2 </p> 
        and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation. Luke 11:4 </p> 
        <p>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. 1 Peter 4:12</p> 
        <p>Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him. James 1:12</p> 
        <p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Hebrews 4:15</p> 
        <p>So that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.  2 Corinthians 2:11 </p> 
        <p>In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. Hebrews 12:4</p> 
        <p>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. James 4:7 </p> 
        <p>For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. Hebrews 2:18 </p> 
        <p>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. Ephesians 6:11</p> 
        <p>And give no opportunity to the devil. Ephesians 4:27</p> 
        <p>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Mark 14:38</p> 
        <p>For you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. James 1:3 </p>
